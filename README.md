## Description

This project was created to provide the customer better way to navigate and interact with their webpage. I edited/modified the HTML and the CSS files to help the customer comply with all the necessary accessibility. Besides that, I also added comment to all the changes I have made, and made sure all the links are working correctly.
Within this project, I've learned and followed the semantic structure of the HTML elements as well as made the codes more clear.
